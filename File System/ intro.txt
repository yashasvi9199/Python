To perform action, we need to open the file first.

Function -> open()
Syntax =>> open("<filename>.<extension>" , <mode><type>)
filename.extension - the file name with extension , with path
mode - action to be performed on file
type - text or binary   (t/b)


Available modes : 
"r" = read only | Error if file exists
"w" = write/overwrite only | Creates file if doesn't exists
"a" = append only | Creates file if doesn't exists
"x" = create new file | Error if file exists

Advanced modes : 
"rb" = Read Only in Binary mode                         | Error
"r+" = Read and Write mode                              | Error
