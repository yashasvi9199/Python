There are three types of access modifiers in Python

- Public Member (Accessible anywhere from outside the class)
- Private Member (Accessible within class)
- Protected Member (Accessible within class and sub class)

Syntax ==>
self.name = name            # Public Member
self._project = project     # Protected Member
self.__salary = salary      # Private Member
